# Computer Science Coding Problems
This is a collection of all the small assignments I was assigned in my IB DP Computer Science HL class. Bigger assignments will have their own project and repositories (linked below), but for the small ones they'll be in the `com.mentoskapraha.comp_sci.assignments` package.  

To run an assignment simply run the Main class then select the one you wish to run.

## Assignments
The code in the `com.mentoskapraha.comp_sci.assignments` package are the solutions for the assignments and are to be used as a **REFERENCE ONLY**. **DO NOT COPY THE CODE!**

### Assignments with External Git Repos
Nothing here for now :)

## Common
The `com.mentoskapraha.comp_sci.common` package contains useful classes and methods. Feel free to copy any code in this package and use it for your own purposes.

## Templates
The `./src/templates` directory contains useful templates that I can then copy and paste to speed up development. At some point I will turn these into IDE snippets, but that might not be for a while.

## Tests - *Work in Progress*
This entire project has unit tests for all assignments, each assignment will have at least 1 unit test and they will be tailored to ensure that assignment is function. In general there will be one that runs the assignment with predetermined data and one with random data that runs the assignment multiple times to simulate real usage. Tests can be run with the gradle test task.
