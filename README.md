# Computer Science Coding Problems
This is a collection of all the small assignments I was assigned in my IB DP Computer Science HL class. Bigger assignments will have their own project and repositories (linked below), but for the small ones they'll be in the `com.mentoskapraha.comp_sci.assignments` package.  

To run an assignment simply run the Main class then select the one you wish to run.

## Assignments
The code in the `com.mentoskapraha.comp_sci.assignments` package are the solutions for the assignments and are to be used as a **REFERENCE ONLY**. **DO NOT COPY THE CODE!**

### Assignments with External Git Repos
Nothing here for now :)

## Common
The `com.mentoskapraha.comp_sci.common` package contains useful classes and methods. Feel free to copy any code in this package and use it for your own purposes.

## Templates
The `./src/templates` directory contains useful templates that I can then copy and paste to speed up development. At some point I will turn these into IDE snippets, but that might not be for a while.

## Tests - *Work in Progress*
This entire project has unit tests for all assignments, each assignment has one unit test that will then run that assignment 3 different times, once with predefined inputs chosen by me and the other 2 times it will randomly generate inputs where appropriate. Certain assignments are only ran once due to their complexity.
