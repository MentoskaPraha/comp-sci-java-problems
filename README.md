# Computer Science Coding Problems
This is a collection of all the small assignments I was assigned in my IB DP Computer Science HL class. Bigger assignments will have their own project and repositories (linked below), but for the small ones they'll be in the `com.mentoskapraha.comp_sci.assignments` package.  

To run an assignment simply run the Main class then select the one you wish to run.

## Assignments
The code in the `com.mentoskapraha.comp_sci.assignments` package are the solutions for the assignments and are to be used as a **REFERENCE ONLY**. **DO NOT COPY THE CODE!**

### Assignments with External Git Repos
Nothing here for now :)

## Common
The `com.mentoskapraha.comp_sci.common` package contains useful classes and methods. Feel free to copy any code in this package and use it for your own purposes.
